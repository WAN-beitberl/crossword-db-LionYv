information stored in a table:
1.a table that links between a crossword and every clue he has.
includes id of a table and id of clues(both can appear multiple times)
the primary key will be both the table id and the clue id

2.a table of all of the words that are clues.
a primary key used to identify them
an answer id that reffers to their answer which is in another table
 
3. a table of all the words that are answers
including a unique primary key to identify them and their length
 
infromation that is not stored in a table:
position of each answer in the puzzle.
the input of a user will not be stored in a table,
but will be compared with the actual answers.
the score will be saved in a variable and not inside a table.
the current word that the user is trying to solve (his position).

4. commands i've used:
CREATE TABLE puzzle (id INTEGER , clue_id INTEGER),PRIMARY KEY(id, clue_id);
CREATE TABLE clues (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value text, answer_id INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE answers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value text, length INTEGER);
